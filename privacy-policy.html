  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 12, 2026</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Real Estate Post Generator API ("Service"), operated by Álvaro ("we", "us", "our"), handles information when you use our Service through the Custom GPT integration or directly via the API.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Receive</h2>
  <p>When you use the Service to generate social media post images, you may provide:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Property details (title, price, location, bedrooms, bathrooms, area, features, description)</li>
    <li>URLs to property photos</li>
    <li>Template preferences (layout, color theme, size, post type)</li>
    <li>Open house event details (date and time)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>The information you provide is used solely to generate the requested social media post image. Specifically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Property data is rendered into the image template and is not stored in any database.</li>
    <li>Photo URLs are fetched temporarily during image rendering and are not saved.</li>
    <li>Generated images are stored temporarily on our server and automatically deleted within 24 hours.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not maintain a database of user information or property data.</li>
    <li>Generated images are stored temporarily for up to 24 hours to allow downloading, after which they are automatically deleted.</li>
    <li>We do not retain any property details, photo URLs, or personal information after the image has been generated.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, trade, or share any information provided to the Service with third parties. Property data and photos are used exclusively for image generation and are not transmitted to any external service beyond what is necessary to render the image.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The Service may fetch images from URLs you provide. These requests are made server-side, and we have no control over the privacy practices of the websites hosting those images. The Service is hosted on Render (render.com), which may collect standard server logs including IP addresses and request metadata as part of their hosting infrastructure.</p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information processed by our Service. All communication with the API is encrypted via HTTPS. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The Service is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.</p>
